important:
-fix sliding after jumping off wall

eh:
-make it harder to get style by just hitting a static enemy with a melee attack until it dies
-aka make the normal dash do almost no damage so that cheesing bosses with it is very boring and is more of an accessibility tool than a way to play the game
-fix eyetree damage when done testing death animations
-make junkyard theme shorter
-original player position is 0.25, -3

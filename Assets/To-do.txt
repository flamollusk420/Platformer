fix explosions killing you (and suspension of disbelief smh)
fix melee/shooting animations when sliding down walls
fix enemies not despawning after dying in a locked room

eh:
-make it harder to get style by just hitting a static enemy with a melee attack until it dies
-make junkyard theme get to the point faster
-fix mixing on abandoned mine theme

stop player from becoming visible while respawning by dashing
make dash jumps get stronger if you do them right after each other (like a mario triple jump)

eh:
-make it harder to get style by just hitting a static enemy with a melee attack until it dies
-make junkyard theme get to the point faster
-fix mixing on abandoned mine theme

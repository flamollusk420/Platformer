important:
-fix the camera when you touch a bunch of transitions in quick succession

eh:
-multiple backgrounds stacked on top of each other for different elevations in the level
-make it harder to get style by just hitting a static enemy with a melee attack until it dies
-fix eyetree damage when done testing death animations
-make junkyard theme shorter
-original player position is 0.25, -3

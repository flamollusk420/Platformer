fix enemies not despawning after dying in a locked room
make check that player is in room that changerooms is trying to lock
reset needstobevisibletomove when enemies respawn

eh:
-make it harder to get style by just hitting a static enemy with a melee attack until it dies
-make junkyard theme get to the point faster
-fix mixing on abandoned mine theme

add parrying your own bullets
make the soul claw spawn at the nearest enemy within a range
wall-slide dash jumps
make parries/attacks feel more impactful
move camera when hitting ground from a downdash
make downdashes gain speed when going far down

eh:
-make it harder to get style by just hitting a static enemy with a melee attack until it dies
-make junkyard theme get to the point faster
-fix mixing on abandoned mine theme

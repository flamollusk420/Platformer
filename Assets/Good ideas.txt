design ideas:
-ms paint secret level
-theme in multiple levels, eyeballs and mystical dream stuff w/ black voids, put it in the tutorial, final boss level, etc.
-volcano level doesn't have normal colored fire, it's in different colors and there's fireworks
-match up animated backgrounds to bpm of songs

mechanic ideas:

-ultrakill-style end-of-level ranking
-s-ranking levels makes the music at the ranking screen cooler with more instruments
-style bonuses for beating a level without dying, beating a level without getting hit, beating a level without healing, and killing every enemy in a level
